**Duration**: 15+ hours<br>
**Software Used**: PTC Creo Parametric<br>
**Skills**: CAD.

Modelled a complete jet engine assembly consisting of approximately 40 components to gain proficiency in PTC Creo and develop parametric CAD skills in a complex mechanical system context.


### üöÄ Key Highlights:
- Used **advanced modeling tools**:
  - **Sweep**, **Blend**, and **Style tool** for organic blade and nacelle geometries  
  - **Spinal Bend** for smooth, curved ducts  
  - **Patterning** and **axis symmetry** to replicate turbine stages  
- Built section views and exploded assemblies to visualize internal operation  
- Ensured full constraint across all sub-assemblies with clean mates and references  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges Faced:
- **Blade orientation issues**: Initially struggled to align blades accurately around the rotor due to improper axis reference. Fixed by creating a central datum system and using polar pattern with datum planes.  
- **Assembly instability**: The engine would occasionally break constraints during movement or regeneration. This was due to over-constraining and misusing "fix" constraints. I rebuilt constraint logic using cleaner reference hierarchies.  
- **Complex surfacing**: The nacelle curvature was difficult to get right using basic extrusions. Switched to the **Style tool** and surface trimming after multiple failed attempts with solid geometry.  



This project wasn't just about mastering Creo tools ‚Äî it taught me the importance of **constraint strategy**, **geometric planning**, and **patience** when working with assemblies that look simple but are technically dense.
